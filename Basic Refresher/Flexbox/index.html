        <h1>FlexBox Introduction</h1>
        <!-- A flex container is any element that has display: flex on it. 
         A flex item is any element that lives directly inside of a flex container. -->
         <!-- All 3 divs should now be arranged horizontally. If you resize the results frame with the “1x”, “.5x” and “.25x” 
     buttons you’ll also see that the divs will ‘flex’. They will fill the available area and will each have equal width. -->

    <!-- As you’ve seen, flexbox is not just a single CSS property but a whole toolbox of properties that you can use to put things where you need them. 
     Some of these properties belong on the flex container, while some go on the flex items. This is an important concept. A flex container is any 
     element that has display: flex on it. A flex item is any element that lives directly inside of a flex container. -->

    <!-- parent: flex container | child: flex items -->

    <!-- Somewhat confusingly, any element can be both a flex container and a flex item. 
     Said another way, you can also put display: flex on a flex item and then use flexbox to arrange its children. -->
    
    <!-- The flex declaration is actually a shorthand for 3 properties that you can set on a flex item. 
     These properties affect how flex items size themselves within their container. You’ve seen some shorthand properties before, 
     but we haven’t officially defined them yet. -->
    
    <!-- Shorthand properties are CSS properties that let you set the values of multiple other CSS properties simultaneously. 
     Using a shorthand property, you can write more concise (and often more readable) stylesheets, saving time and energy. -->

    <!-- e.g. margin is a shorthand for margin-top, margin-bottom, margin-left and margin-right -->

    <!-- In this case, flex is actually a shorthand for flex-grow, flex-shrink and flex-basis. -->
    
    <!-- flex: 1 equates to: flex-grow: 1, flex-shrink: 1, flex-basis: 0. -->
    
    <!-- Very often you see the flex shorthand defined with only one value. In that case, that value is applied to flex-grow. 
     So when we put flex: 1 on our divs, we were actually specifying a shorthand of flex: 1 1 0. -->

     <!-- flex-shrink is similar to flex-grow, but sets the “shrink factor” of a flex item. flex-shrink only ends up 
     being applied if the size of all flex items is larger than their parent container. For example, if our 3 divs 
     from above had a width declaration like: width: 100px, and .flex-container was smaller than 300px, our divs would have to shrink to fit. 
     The default shrink factor is flex-shrink: 1, which means all items will shrink evenly. If you do not want an item to shrink then you 
     can specify flex-shrink: 0;. You can also specify higher numbers to make certain items shrink at a higher rate than normal. 
     Here’s an example. Note that we’ve also changed the flex-basis for reasons that will be explained shortly. 
     If you shrink your browser window you’ll notice that .two never gets smaller than the given width of 250px, 
     even though the flex-grow rule would otherwise specify that each element should be equally sized. -->
    
    <!-- flex-basis sets the initial size of a flex item, so any sort of flex-growing or flex-shrinking starts from that baseline size. 
    The shorthand value defaults to flex-basis: 0%. The reason we had to change it to auto in the flex-shrink example is that with the basis 
    set to 0, those items would ignore the item’s width, and everything would shrink evenly. Using auto as a flex-basis tells the item 
    to check for a width declaration (width: 250px). -->

    <!-- There is a difference between the default value of flex-basis and the way the flex shorthand defines it if no flex-basis is given. 
     The actual default value for flex-basis is auto, but when you specify flex: 1 on an element, it interprets that as flex: 1 1 0.
     If you want to only adjust an item’s flex-grow you can do so directly, without the shorthand. Or you can be more verbose and 
     use the full 3 value shorthand flex: 1 1 auto, which is also equivalent to using flex: auto. -->
    
    <!-- If you noticed, we mentioned a new flex shorthand flex: auto in the previous note. However we didn’t fully introduce it. 
     flex: auto is one of the shorthands of flex. When auto is defined as a flex keyword it is equivalent to the values of flex-grow: 
     1, flex-shrink: 1 and flex-basis: auto or to flex: 1 1 auto using the flex shorthand. Note that flex: auto is not the default 
     value when using the flex shorthand despite the name being “auto” which may be slightly confusing at first. You will encounter 
     and learn more about flex: auto and its potential use-cases when reading through the assignment section. -->
    
    <!-- Essentially, flex describes how the elements shrink or grows with respect to the size of the browser window. -->
