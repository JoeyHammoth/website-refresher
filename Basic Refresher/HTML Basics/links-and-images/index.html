        <h1>Various Links</h1>
        <!-- anchor tag to create hypertext reference -->
        <!-- href = dest -->
        <!-- target = where the linked resource will be opened. if empty, _self opens in current tab. _blank opens another tab -->
        <!-- rel = relation between the current page and the linked document. noreferrer value prevents 
         the opened link from knowing which webpage or resource has a link (or ‘reference’) to it. 
         noopener prevents the opened link from gaining access to the webpage from which it was opened.
         noreferrer has noopener behaviour so use noreferrer. -->

        <!-- Links to pages on other websites on the internet are called absolute links. 
         A typical absolute link will be made up of the following parts: protocol://domain/path. 
         An absolute link will always contain the protocol and domain of the destination. -->
        
        <!-- Links to other pages within our own website are called relative links. 
         Relative links do not include the domain name, since it is another page on the same site, 
         it assumes the domain name will be the same as the page we created the link on. -->

        <!-- To display an image in HTML we use the <img> element. Unlike the other elements we have encountered, the <img> element is a void element. 
         As we have seen earlier in the course, void elements do not need a closing tag because they are naturally empty and do not contain any content. -->
        
        <!-- Instead of wrapping content with an opening and closing tag, it embeds an image into the page using a src attribute which tells the 
         browser where the image file is located. The src attribute works much like the href attribute for anchor tags. 
         It can embed an image using both absolute and relative paths. -->
        
        <!-- Besides the src attribute, every image element must also have an alt (alternative text) attribute. -->
        <!-- The alt attribute is used to describe an image. It will be used in place of the image if it cannot be loaded. 
         It is also used with screen readers to describe what the image is to visually impaired users. -->
        
        <!-- While not strictly required, specifying height and width attributes in image tags helps the browser 
         layout the page without causing the page to jump and flash. -->
