<!-- The cascade is what determines which rules actually get applied to our HTML. 
 There are different factors that the cascade uses to determine this. We will examine three of these factors, 
 which will hopefully help you avoid those frustrating “I hate CSS” moments. -->

<!-- A CSS declaration that is more specific will take precedence over less specific ones. 
 Inline styles, which we went over in the previous lesson, have the highest specificity compared to selectors, 
 while each type of selector has its own specificity level that contributes to how specific a declaration is. 
 Other selectors contribute to specificity, but we’re focusing only on the ones we’ve gone over so far: -->

<!-- ID selectors (most specific selector)
     Class selectors
     Type selectors -->

<!-- Specificity will only be taken into account when an element has multiple, 
 conflicting declarations targeting it, sort of like a tie-breaker. 
 An ID selector will always beat any number of class selectors, a class selector will always beat any number of type selectors, 
 and a type selector will always beat any number of less specific selectors. When there is no declaration with a selector of higher specificity, 
 a rule with a greater number of selectors of the same type will take precedence over another rule with fewer selectors of the same type. -->
