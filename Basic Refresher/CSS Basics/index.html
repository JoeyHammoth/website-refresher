<!-- At the most basic level, CSS is made up of various rules. 
 These rules are made up of a selector (more on this in a bit) and a semicolon-separated list of declarations, 
 with each of those declarations being made up of a property–value pair. -->

<!-- div.bold-text { -> selector
    font-weight: 700; -> declaration
 } -->

<!-- A <div> is one of the basic HTML elements. It is an empty container. 
In general, it is best to use other tags such as <h1> or <p> for content in your projects, 
but as we learn more about CSS you’ll find that there are many cases where the thing you need is just a container for other elements. 
Many of our exercises use plain<div>s for simplicity. Later lessons will go into much more depth about when it is appropriate to use the various HTML elements. -->

<!-- The universal selector will select elements of any type, hence the name “universal”, and the syntax for it is a simple asterisk. 
 In the example below, every element would have the color: purple; style applied to it. -->

<!-- * {
  color: purple;
}
 -->

<!-- A type selector (or element selector) will select all elements of the given element type, and the syntax is just the name of the element. -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <title>Am Adventure in CSS</title>

        <!-- Adding CSS to HTML -->

        <!-- External CSS is the most common method you will come across, and it involves creating a separate file 
        for the CSS and linking it inside of an HTML’s opening and closing <head> tags with a void <link> element: -->

        <!-- First, we add a void <link> element inside of the opening and closing <head> tags of the HTML file. 
        The href attribute is the location of the CSS file, either an absolute URL or, what you’ll be utilizing, 
        a URL relative to the location of the HTML file. In our example above, we are assuming both files are located in the same directory. 
        The rel attribute is required, and it specifies the relationship between the HTML file and the linked file. -->
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">

        <!-- embedded css -->
        <style>
            .test1 {
                color:aquamarine;
                background-color: azure;
                text-align: end;
            }
        </style>
    </head>
    <body>
        <!-- Note the syntax for class selectors: a period immediately followed by the case-sensitive value of the class attribute. 
        Classes aren’t required to be specific to a particular element, so you can use the same class on as many elements as you want. -->

        <!-- Another thing you can do with the class attribute is to add multiple classes to a single element as a space-separated list, 
        such as class="alert-text severe-alert". Since whitespace is used to separate class names like this, you should never use spaces for multi-worded names and should use a hyphen instead. -->

        <!-- ID selectors are similar to class selectors. They select an element with the given ID, which is another attribute you place on an HTML element. 
        The major difference between classes and IDs is that an element can only have one ID. It cannot be repeated on a single page and should not contain any whitespace: -->
        <h1>Amazing Things you can do with CSS!</h1>
        <div class="ancestor">
            hello
            <div class="parent">
