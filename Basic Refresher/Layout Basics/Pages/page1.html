        <!-- CSS has two box types: block and inline boxes, which determine element behavior and interaction. 
     The display property controls how HTML elements appear on the webpage. We will explore its various options further in this lesson. -->

     <!-- By default, block elements will appear on the page stacked atop each other, each new element starting on a new line. -->

     <!-- Inline elements, however, do not start on a new line. They appear in line with whatever elements they are placed beside. 
      A clear example of an inline element is a link, or <a> tag. If you stick one of these in the middle of a paragraph of text, 
      the link will behave like a part of the paragraph. Additionally, padding and margin behave differently on inline elements. 
      In general, you do not want to try to put extra padding or margin on inline elements. -->

      <!-- Div is a block-level element by default. It is commonly used as a container element to group other elements. 
       Divs allow us to divide the page into different blocks and apply styling to those blocks. -->

       <!-- Span is an inline-level element by default. It can be used to group text content and inline HTML elements 
        for styling and should only be used when no other semantic HTML element is appropriate. -->
